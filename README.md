# Engineering/Design and Algorithms/Data Structures will be completed using this program.  So, it will be known as artifact 1 and 2.  The enhancements I intend to make are changing the slides from 5 to 10.  I plan on changing the theme of the slideshow from top 5 destinations to my 10 favorite moments of the IU women’s basketball team.  I’ll change the background of the slideshow to a more appropriate team themed background.  I'll also add a reset button that will put the slideshow back to slide one.  For the algorithm and Data structure element, I will create an algorithm that will automate the slide show.  It will use a timer so each slide will display for 5 seconds.  Pressing the reset button starts the slide show over.  I'll also use an array data structure for the images of the slide show.  This will replace the series of if and if else statements that are currently being used.
